<h2>Kinky Interspecies Intimacy (via Holding Hands)</h2>

<p><i>Written by Machina on October 15th, 2024.</i></p>

<p>Sometimes, as a system, we'll write out memories and things we're doing together in a creative nonfiction sort of way - it's written like fiction, but the events we're writing did actually happen to us.</p>  

<p>This bit between Jude and Gavin feels like it's pretty relevant to the way we experience partnership together, as kink partners specifically in this context, and how nonsexual intimacy is affected by having an interspecies (human/android) relationship in headspace where that does affect physical interaction.</p>  

<p>We'd greatly appreciate it if you were honest about being an adult before interacting with this. Also, feel free to say this is cute if you want; I think they're adorable, but I'm biased.</p>

<p><strong>Content notes:</strong> Swearing, physical touch and vulnerability, some self-deprecating internal judgements, general nonsexual submission and dominance. This is all written as adults doing consensual kink together, and also they're literally holding hands.</p> 

<p>--</p>

<p>He's holding their hand as they shut off their projectors, and it's - it's not <i>actually</i> that different as the synthskin crawls up their fingers, baring white and black chassis to his tan skin, but he rubs his thumb gently over their fingers and they <i>jolt.</i></p>

<p>"You good?" He stops, not loosening his grip, and they shiver and nod and just try to breathe like a normal person as they keep going, bare chassis all the way up their forearm.</p>

<p>It's really not <i>that</i> sensitive, they've had their exposed chassis held and manipulated and inspected before, they've interfaced with other androids before, and that doesn't explain why the pressure of Gavin's hand on theirs kinda makes them feel like they're hot and tingling and melting. Just a bit.</p>

<p>Really. He's not even capable of syncing with them, it's kinda stupid that they're reacting this way. They think this and then he runs his thumb over their hand again and they twitch and fucking <i>squeak</i> because that feels like <i>so much.</i></p>

<p>"Is that a good sound?" He sounds halfway between being concerned and being amused, which is fair because that was sure a dumb noise they just made.</p>

<p>"Yeah? Yeah, it's just - fuck? Keep going?"</p>

<p>It's not a lot in a sexual way. Not even in a sexual way! It's just, <i>hhh,</i> it's just like - everything feels overwhelming and <i>a lot</i> and this is ridiculous because they've done this before and it usually <i>doesn't,</i> so maybe they're just kind of a freak about this. Or maybe it feels different with a hot person. They don't have a good sample size.</p>

<p>So. Gavin hums idly, traces his hand down to wrap his fingers around their wrist, testing. Pressing.</p>

<p>Jude feels like maybe this is killing them. They just made a strangled sound into their other arm that might've once been something like <i>holy fuck,</i> because god you can't do this they're <i>dying.</i></p>

<p>"Okay, so this is fine, right?" They can <i>hear</i> him smirking.</p>

<p>"Mhm," they say, very eloquently. Their hand is clenched into a fist on the table between them. They feel very much like they're overheating even though they're really not, just hot and tingly and vulnerable and it's kinda overwhelming but like. Good? Okay? This is happening? Fuck??</p>

<p>"How's it feel?"</p>

<p>They take a second to process that with all the everything. "Um. Weird. Good? Kinda just um, hot and tingly, not in the sex way in the I'm gonna explode way."</p>

<p>"Too much?"</p>

<p>"No, just - maybe? Maybe, talking's hard, uh, handholding's fine?"</p>

<p>He takes a second to move back to their hand, and oh okay their wrist is still kinda tingling, this is fine. "Subspace your android with one neat trick," he snickers.</p>

<p>"Shut up." They snort, batting at him with their other hand, and he just laughs more like the jerk he is.</p>

<p>"I'm right, you <i>do</i> do that."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well."</p>
