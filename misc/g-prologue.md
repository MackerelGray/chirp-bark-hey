# G. murder (...2!)

<p><i>Written by Max on August 16, 2020.</i></p>

<p>Gavin here! So we put that first snippet of <i>Machina</i> out there, well-shielded from public scrutiny by the access list, and hey, that wasn't so bad! It's kinda nervewracking to post, but that's bound to be true for anything so personal. We have a (very) short backlog of scenes that are already written, with far more in outline and concept form, and I thought sharing them on Dreamwidth would be interesting and entertaining! People love writing introspective personal essays in this community, and I feel like changing up the format with creative fiction memory prose is just fun as hell.</p>  

<p>This is not the direct scene after Jude's prologue - that would be my prologue, but it's not fully written yet, and neither is our first meeting, actually. This is the next part that's actually been written out! If I'm remembering correctly, it was very loosely based on the chase scene in The Nest chapter of DBH, but not closely - the suspect is a different deviant than in the game, and this scene happens before Hank and Connor find Ortiz's android, which is in the next unwritten scene or two. This was actually the first scene that was ever written for the current iteration of the story, and even after I got here we didn't change it because - yeah! It's still accurate! That's the fucking vibe! So here you go, have another scene about Jude killing a guy, except this time they have a witness so it looks as fucked up as it is.</p>  

<p>Feel free to leave a comment, ask questions, whatever - we love talking to friends, and if you can see and read this, you're counted as a friend!</p>

<p>Gavin stops to lean against the railing of the walkway, gasping for breath, which is <i>ridiculous</i> given how much he runs but apparently - <i>apparently!</i> - he has nothing on his deviant-chasing <i>maniac</i> of a partner, who took one look at the suspect fleeing the scene and decided to make it a race.</p>  

<p>He needs to handcuff them to him. Install a tracking device on his phone. At least make it so he knows which way they fucking <i>went</i> after leaving him in the dust while jumping over fences and rooftops like some action-movie parkour enthusiast.</p>  

<p>&ldquo;Oh, fuck this,&rdquo; he pants, very eloquently describing his feelings as he pushes off the rail and cranes his head around for some sign of a scuffle. &ldquo;Hey, <i>Judah!&rdquo;</i></p>  

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t expect a response, really - especially not one so fast.</p>  

<p>&ldquo;Caught it!&rdquo;</p>  

<p>Hooray, at least <i>one</i> of them is happy. They don&rsquo;t even have the decency to sound out of breath, what the fuck <i>are</i> androids? He keeps that train of thought up as he forces himself to jog over to the end of the walkway, climb up the goddamn ladder to the rooftop and they&rsquo;d <i>better</i> have the bastard in cuffs already.</p>  

<p>He reaches the top and steps onto the concrete, looking down at them. &ldquo;What -&rdquo;</p>  

<p>There&rsquo;s blood on the concrete.</p>  

<p>It&rsquo;s blue, yeah, but there&rsquo;s <i>blood</i> pooling around them - actually <i>pooling,</i> like someone spilled a whole bowl of punch at a Halloween party, filling the air with a raw chemical smell that&rsquo;s acrid in his throat. They&rsquo;re on one knee in it, dark blue splattered across their suit, on that cyan hexagon, and it's not theirs.</p>  

<p>The suspect is splayed out under them. His hair is ginger. Was. It&rsquo;s staining this violently bright, cleaning-product blue, pouring out from his chest where a knife is buried - a <i>knife,</i> where the fuck did they get -</p>  

<p>&ldquo;I caught it.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Gavin looks at Judah.</p>  <p>They grin at him, LED bright blue, blood splattered on their cheek, sharp and excited like a dog that just caught a rabbit. Gavin feels <i>sick.</i></p>  

<p><i>What the fuck did CyberLife send us?</i></p>
