# Weird Wereraptor Insights

<p><i>Written by Max Biscuit-Machina on August 19th, 2025.</i></p>

<p>hi! this is a completely unpolished brain dump of information about my experiences as a wereraptor, because it's too interesting to stay stuck in my drafts for days while I work up the executive functioning to edit it into a cohesive essay! you're getting the same lowercase rambling my friends get about my identity and you're going to like it!</p>

<p>first off, i don't think i Awakened - i didn't have some sudden blast of insight about being fictional or nonhuman one day. I Chose A Label. i didn't always feel nonhuman, in fact i frequently felt Very Human combined with Situational Nonhumanity (mostly getting phantoms and instincts and making sounds re: physical play, tasty food, and mauling a plush animal for fun), which was not what i saw amongst many therians who felt like they were 100% nonhuman all the time. so i picked up "yeah this velociraptor is important to me, i draw this raptor a lot! it's fun to draw!" and had imposter syndrome about saying i was a therian for Years™</p>

<p>like i gotta emphasize that i lurked around people discussing their therianthropy for years and for some reason i didn't make the leap to "therians identify, fully OR PARTIALLY, as animals" because. i didn't really see anyone talk about being like 90% human 10% raptor (and the raptor is only ever there when i'm having fun so perhaps this is not a real identity and just a Fun Thing)</p>

<p>(no past!max. it's a very real raptor in there. it just hates calculus)<br>
go my raptor bite the numbers for me</p>

<p>like it really is fascinating looking back and seeing how much more blended together i was with Biscuit and also how that did not really serve us well! i was getting phantom shifts and mental shifts and generally talking about myself as a raptor, as a therian, in the way that so many other therians talked about themselves. and i did think of myself that way! but it felt forced, it didn't feel like i was a raptor in a comfortable way</p>

<p>it's not that I'm Not a raptor, but i do legitimately feel better thinking of Biscuit as kind of a daemon! it's not just Me But Raptor, it has entirely different nonhuman priorities from me and i communicate With it better now that I'm not parsing myself through the lens of being nonhuman</p>

<p>see if I'm a human person, I can Talk to the chicken and it can have fun scampering around me while I cook. very beautiful and powerful life I have</p>

<p>the chicken doesn't know chicken tenders will NOT taste good raw frozen</p>

<p>biscuit is So Certain of the deliciousness of raw meats. it can projection nomf them now instead of wanting to get my very human tastebuds involved in bland gross raw pork<br>
✨ enrichment ✨</p>

<p>[re: friends talking about Raw Meat Dishes]<br>
don't try to sell me on raw meat products, i can't make them right now and biscuit will be sad</p>

<p>also all of these dishes have some kind of seasoning, biscuit thinks Raw Meat With Left Floor Dirt would be fantastic</p>

<p>it says mmmmmm roadkill</p>

<p>another difference between me and lots of therians i saw was that i don't generally have species dysphoria! i induce cameo shifts of not-me nonhuman things sometimes and that's fun, and i got absolutely no species dysphoria about being human and not being a raptor</p>

<p>which is interesting in contrast with Jude and Gavin who do have species dysphoria pretty bad, and Biscuit who does not know what dysphoria is but gets Mad it cant stick my nonexistent snoot into a bowl</p>

<p>it doesn't feel a pervasive sense of unease or dissatisfaction with its body because it doesn't process that my body is Not A Raptor Body, it gets the phantom body after all, it just thinks Wow You're Bad At Raptoring. SMH</p>

<p>(i make up for it by being good at humaning)</p>

<p>and it does not think it's in a human body while shifted, it doesn't actually like. grasp that there Are any fundamental differences between Its Raptor Body and mine, because it lived in my body its whole life and understands This Is Simply The Normal And Average Raptor Body™</p>

<p>it's like a fucking stork imprinted on humans</p>

<p>it holds its arms like wings and sniffs the air and tries to bite things that seem like they're in biting range but are actually several inches away from my face</p>

<p>curiosity biting btw. like check out this cardboard i bet its cardboard tasting. gotta find out if its chewable</p>

<p>unfortunately many of the things it wants to bite are things that i Know will taste bad. therefore i beam the Bad Taste at it and it understands. ah. the unchewable new thing</p>

<p>ngl it's Extremely Funny to me that it just... does not get Any dissonance At All from being in a human body? it's been here its whole life! it thinks this is a Normal Raptor Body Dammit. Biscuit doesn't know what a species is but it knows it is a raptor and therefore if it's moving my body that's a Normal Raptor doing Normal Raptor things</p>

<p>Normal Raptors walk comfortably on two legs and sit down in chairs and eat delicious spicy curry! that's what it's done for many many years after all! why would that be Weird For A Raptor? that's Normal. raptors are social animals that pick up social cues and everyone including me was like "yeah this is normal and how things work"</p>

<p>it also registers all the humans around it like Oh Yes You're Like Me, again because it grew up in human society and thinks Humans Are Just Like Raptors (But They Have Weird Food Opinions)</p>

<p>i do think it imprinted on humans like a duckling would, and that's why it just doesn't feel confused about the human experience. it's a bird with nonexistent species boundaries</p>

<p>it recognizes other velociraptors by snout shape and build when i look at paleoart - I'm the only one who gets mad that most of the raptors don't have the right colors for it lmao</p>

<p>also i say it doesn't understand appliances, but it Does, kind of. it understands that I use them to make food hot and therefore tasty. it does not really get how to use them itself because it thinks it's in A Normal Raptor Body and holds our arms like its wings when in front. and we don't have a snout to open microwave door with! Very Frustrating! why do you have things it can't move to make food tasty. that's rude and mean</p>

<p>as the human being in this relationship I know how hands work, and can therefore do beautiful things like open doors and cook food and type words on a keyboard</p>

<p>it is WAY happier being projected out into the world around me instead of giving us phantom/mental shifts nowadays. whenever it fronts I'm gripped by the memory of my poor handless snootless beast trying to figure out how to open Cheetos bag. (it didn't succeed and i opened the bag for us)</p>

<p>well it has hands! it just doesn't know how thumbs work</p>

<p>hey Biscuit, you don't know you're in a human body do you? no. you're a little raptor creature and you wanted to bite my new headphones to understand them better. you're very silly. like a cat</p>

<p>also in the same way Biscuit has a humansona (me), I have a raptorsona (it)! which means sometimes I'll be the one projected in a raptor form, and Jude and Gav can tell that's me and not Biscuit because I talk like a person and don't generally chew on anything and emote more like a human (nodding, rolling my eyes, generally responding to conversation, being more animated like a CGI animal than a theriform one)</p>

<p>it's fun to be in a very emotive raptor body, and i like having it as my online persona! i like chirping at my friends and getting pats and play-pouncing on them as a 15-pound little beast. it's my body just as much as my human one, kinda like how Biscuit considers my human body the same as its raptor body. I may be human by default, but that doesn't mean my joy in being a raptor is any less meaningful</p>

<p>i started out saying i was a raptor because i felt like one, back when i worked up the courage to call myself a therian in 2018, but i don't think that's really true anymore?</p>

<p>i don't think I'm an animal person in the "i feel like a raptor" way, so much as I'm a raptor by close association with Biscuit, who Doesn't differentiate specieswise or selfwise between itself and me because it relies on me to get all our human work done! and it only really comes out when we're resting and it wants to eat or play or beg my friends for virtual meats which i import into our projected surroundings lmao<br>
(it can do a very good pleading raptor face btw. blinking forlornly until treat is showered upon it)</p>

<p>I'm a raptor because this raptor in my brain has claimed me as its packmate and it doesn't wanna be separate from me because it was not separate from me for like 2 decades of our life together. we're clearly distinct from each other now but also we're a package deal and I'd be very different if Biscuit wasn't around, and it sure wouldn't be okay if i were gone! it likes being bundled together with me so I'm a raptor because Biscuit is a raptor and We are Me</p>

<p>TL;DR I'm raptorkin (I'm the family of this One (1) raptor) and that's very cool of me</p>
