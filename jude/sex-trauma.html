<h2>sex trauma braindump</h2>

<p><i>Written by Jude Rook-Machina on August 16th, 2025.</i></p>

<p>So instead of trying to process all this by rereading my essay about rape over and over and doubting myself and asking if it's actually that bad, I decided to see if writing it out helps with anything. Creative writing to process a memory is nothing new for me. I think it's helping? I think writing helps. It's easier to see where it's obviously not consensual. If consent is FRIES (freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, specific) then uh. Most of that didn't happen and I was specifically ashamed of being enthusiastic. So it seems pretty obvious that it was bad in hindsight?</p>

<p>I'm posting this because I. want someone to know how I felt without judging me? I guess? It's easier to not judge myself if other people can see exactly what I did and they're choosing not to judge me anyway.</p>

<p><b>Content Warning:</b> I mean, it's rape. It's complicated guiltily enthusiastic sex that's nonconsensual based on circumstance, and nobody involved was capable of giving or getting full consent so nobody's exactly a rapist, but. You know. There's also my murder mission underlying the whole thing, and my general extremely unreliable narration (if I say I don't want it and I just have to do it, I'm Lying).</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>There's something specific that's supposed to happen, as a deviant hunter, when Judah catches sight of their target and feels heat flushing their face, rising in their throat. Thinks, <i>oh, you could pin me down and use me no problem.</i></p>

<p>(Not that they're supposed to think that. Or <em>feel</em> that, really, all things considered, but—well, it's not about the sex. It's for the job. It's easier, quicker, if they finish the job this way with targets like this. She hasn't said anything against them yet.)</p>

<p>Judah knows what they're supposed to do in this situation. They know what's supposed to happen. They have a system for it.</p>

<p>They give it a little greeting ping. It doesn't react outwardly, but it lights up in the connection they make over the network. <i>Oh, you're another deviant, hello!</i></p>

<p>Judah asks if that seat is taken, of course it's not, and sits down next to it. They chat aimlessly about something or another, half out loud and half in pings. They get close, a friendly distance. A little closer. They drop a few hints. They don't need to play up their interest. That's sincere enough.</p>

<p>(It's just more practical, really. They can't take it out back without a struggle, and if there's a struggle, that's a chance they'll be caught. They can't be caught. They have to do this.)</p>

<p>It hesitates, wonders in the loud silence of their link if it'll hurt them, if they know what they're asking for, and Judah catches their thought that <em>come on,</em> <i>that's the point!</i> before it crosses over and they say, <i>I trust you not to hurt me, just, please, it's been—I haven't had sex with anyone who—cares. About me. Please?</i></p>

<p>(It's not a lie. Well they're lying about how much they need it, they're not actually begging for this, it's just for the job. It's just for the job.)</p>

<p>It reaches across the scant space between them, rests its hand on their thigh, and maybe it's meant to be a comforting gesture but they're wound up enough that they shudder a bit, lean into its body to feel the heat of it as they beg, <i>please?</i></p>

<p>(See, it's touching them now, that's how this works. They can relax now. Melt into it. They know how this works.)</p>

<p><i>Okay,</i> it says, and it leads them out—somewhere secluded from the ruckus inside, somewhere safe where nobody's watching. They have to be quick about it, quick and quiet, and luckily Judah has practice with this. They've done it before, they know the steps.</p>

<p>It kisses them, and they kiss back, and it feels good and they can taste the data washing over them <i>repeating repeating repeating,</i> this is your target this is your target this is your target you're close enough to your goal that you can <em>taste</em> it.</p>

<p>It couldn't taste them back, not designed to, but it hums into their mouth as it squeezes their ass. They push into it. (They're allowed that. It's already touching them. They're encouraging this to move in the right direction.)</p>

<p>They don't kiss for long, pressured by time, and it gets their belt unbuckled and works on its own as they shove their pants down to their thighs and they're wet already, been  wet since it touched them, they're so ready to go so <i>can you hurry up?</i></p>

<p>It huffs laughter at them through the link and they're drowning in heat already and the shame of <em>wanting</em> doesn't make it go away. And then it's pressed up against them again, holding them up, skin to skin, and it's pressing into them and they muffle their whines into its mouth.</p>

<p>(Sex feels good in a way that's paradoxical, that means nothing. They're not getting closer to their goal like this, with their legs around its hips and nonsense sensation arcing up their spine, but that doesn't matter that doesn't matter please don't stop please please please—)</p>

<p>They come gasping, whimpering under it, before it's done fucking them. It fucks them through it, tells them how good they feel clenching around it, and shame pounds through them as hot as the overstimulation.</p>

<p>It orgasms inside them, grinding in little motions that make them twitch, and stays there for a few seconds. catching its breath. Judah's lowered to the ground to stand on their own trembling legs, pull their own pants back up.</p>

<p><i>Fuck. That—was that okay, was that what you wanted?</i> it asks.</p>

<p><i>That was, that was great,</i> they say, lying, and pull it down into another kiss. They kill it quick and quiet, like they're supposed to.</p>

<p>(See? It works. It's good for the job. She'll be proud of them, that they killed it so well. They'll just have to do it again.)</p>
