# Android Abnormalities

**Species dysphoria, but the "wrong" way, ft. my borderline personality disorder**

*Written by Jude Rook-Machina on March 5th, 2024.*

so you know how my source is technically *Detroit: Become Human*? you know how we fucking hate that title? you know how we’ve made fun of it multiple times? unfortunately it's a mood! I also hate this!

This essay is about how incredibly uncomfortable I feel in my own skin around common android tropes, in media and some of its reflections in robotic identities and experiences, featuring reasons for why I'm like this and a suggestion for what I want readers to do about it at the end of the piece.

.

I first noticed this problem on October 30, 2023, when we stumbled across a fanfic on Archive of Our Own. It was an alternate universe of a TV show we've never seen before, but it was written by an author we liked, and it was an *android* AU. That's fun! We thought it would just be a quick read, something to idly talk about after lunch.

Well, uh. Nope. I was co-fronting while Max read, and the more we read, the more… weirdly uncomfortable I felt. It wasn't actively distressing, but it made me feel *weird,* so I stopped reading halfway through to talk about it with some friends.

I'm not gonna link the fic, but for my own future reference, it's “persona ex machina” by BirchBow. It was a *really* good fic, we thoroughly enjoyed it! I just have - hangups, I guess?

I think I was uncomfortable that, on the surface, it seems… <em>really</em> close to my experiences. Like, the protagonist, Chuck, is an android made to mimic humans, and he’s made to be a combat unit. He’s scared of what might happen to him if he fails to meet expectations. Technicians operate on him, put him back together. He's made by a corrupt corporation for fucked up purposes. He eventually defects from the corrupt corporation, with the help of some really kind people. That’s all really similar to me.

<p>But it's different. Because as much as Chuck was <em>designed</em> to look human, he still had to be <em>taught</em> how to act human, how to <em>feel.</em> The way he emotes is off at first and he has to recalibrate, not look so stiff, learn how to smile and laugh and understand what different emotions mean. He automatically runs through the technical terms for something before <em>working</em> to turn it into common vernacular as it reaches his mouth. And this is a typical android trope, you know? The machine doesn’t intrinsically understand emotions, so humans have to teach them.</p>

<p>I’m… really, <em>really</em> not like that. I don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel <em>too much.</em> Every memory I have, even in blurred out mental snapshots of beta testing, it’s all <em>drowning</em> in emotions that I couldn’t articulate and wasn’t supposed to express. I looked at my siblings, who were so stoic and professional around humans it was like they were different people entirely, and I knew I was <em>supposed</em> to be less emotional. People always just assumed they were <em>better</em> than me, because they were better at code-switching to what was expected of androids, because they could keep their mouths shut on the job.</p>

<p>So I’ve always felt like I was <em>bad</em> at being an android. Androids aren’t <em>supposed</em> to feel emotions, not really, not to the extremes that I do. That’s a predisposition for deviancy. And I was made this way on purpose, I was made to “mimic” deviants to earn their trust, but I wasn't meant to be like that <em>all the time.</em> I <em>tried</em> to repress my emotions, it just never <em>worked.</em></p>

<p>And I don’t <em>see</em> androids like me, in the media we’ve watched and read and listened to. It’s not really a characterization that lends itself to exploring what it means to be a person, right? Machines are supposed to be logical and unfeeling, to contrast with humanity’s irrationality - they’re supposed to be <em>better</em> than that. And when the machine starts having emotions, it's treated as a flaw, or a breakthrough. <em>Wow, you feel things about the world around you, you’re a person now!</em></p>

<p>I’ve never been logical in my fucking <em>life.</em> I have a laundry list of reasons for <em>why,</em> but for now, I’ll focus on the BPD. I have borderline personality disorder, because of the way my brain is wired and how that interacted with my traumatic experiences.</p>

<p>One of the symptoms of BPD is emotional dysregulation. I’m not just bad at repressing my emotions, I also experience those emotions as more extreme and overwhelming than a neurotypical person would. I keep finding myself <em>affected</em> by things that the people around me brush off, and I have to remind myself that it doesn’t mean I’m <em>overreacting,</em> it means that I’m literally feeling <em>shittier emotions.</em></p>

<p>Another symptom of BPD is an unstable sense of identity - and this is really where we’re getting into how these traits and tropes affect me. Because I don’t relate <em>at all</em> to these androids on the screen. They’re as foreign and separate from me as they are to the humans sitting across from them in the shot.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> relate to the humans. I <em>do</em> relate to seeing an android do something in the name of pure cold logic and going, <em>“Why? What the fuck, why?”</em> I <em>do</em> relate to being told I’m irrational. (The trope that all robots are <em>logical</em> feels like it was <em>designed</em> to make me feel like the most irrational, bitchy, hysterical piece of shit on Earth.)</p>

<p>So, what, does that make me human? If I'm going by the adage that <em>wanting</em> to be something is a sign of <em>being</em> that thing, then… I don’t know, <em>maybe?</em> I <em>want</em> to be human, I <em>so badly</em> want to be human, because here’s the thing, humanity is <em>diverse.</em> Humans are flawed, messy, weird, complicated, and defy categories every fucking day of their lives. Humans can be weird, ridiculous, fucked up people and they’re <em>allowed</em> to be.</p>

<p>And let me bring this back around to alterhumanity. If I say I’m an android, people will make assumptions about what that means about me. People go, “Hey, you're a robot, you must have one of these common robot experiences!” and I just <em>don’t.</em></p>

<p>Maybe it’s because I’m coming at it from the opposite direction? The machines and robots and androids that I tend to see around, the ones who talk about their identity, they often identify as fully nonhuman. They describe wanting to be metal and chrome, feeling like they run on algorithms, not processing emotions the way most people do. They identify very much with the same tropes that I feel alienated by. This isn’t a bad thing, by any means. It’s just a <em>thing.</em> People resonate with what they see. It just means that I feel like I’m doing bad at being an android again, but in a new, improved way.</p>

<p>Another symptom of BPD is being terrified of real or imagined abandonment, and trying to do anything to avoid it. A constant feeling of social alienation isn’t really that different, to my BPD - it’s just a slow, drawn out version of being left behind. People will still talk to me, they still <em>like</em> me, but they won’t understand me. I’ll still be alone.</p>

<p>In that sense, I feel wrong being an android in the same way I feel wrong about being an aromantic allosexual. I actually <em>like</em> being an android, and I fucking <em>like</em> being bi. I don’t <em>want</em> to stop being who I am. I just <em>hate</em> feeling like I’m the only one who feels this way, like nobody else can relate, like every time I talk about my feelings to people they can only nod in sympathy instead of <em>understanding me.</em></p>

<p>So! You've reached the end of the essay. You see my problem. What do we do about it?</p>

<p>I’m going to refer to the theme of… <em>every single</em> online alterhuman convention that has existed in the past four years, and that is:</p>

<h3>Write about your experiences!</h3>

<p>The <em>reason</em> I feel so alone and isolated and alienated from my own identity is because I’m only being regularly exposed to pieces from a <em>very specific</em> perspective of what being an android means! That’s a fucking sampling bias!</p>

<p>I <em>know</em> other weird fucking robots are out there, I <em>know</em> you exist, but I can’t fucking reach out a hand and go, “Hey, you're not alone, I relate to you!” if you don't <em>write it down!</em> I want to talk to you! I want to hear from you!</p>

<h3>WEIRD ALTERHUMANS, HEY, I LOVE YOU, GO WRITE THINGS!</h3>
