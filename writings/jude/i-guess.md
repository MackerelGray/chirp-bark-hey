<h2>I guess we're doing dragons now</h2>

<p>so a few days ago I got Poisoned</p>

<p>(double dosed on a med while sleep deprived, called poison control, they said I was going to be fine, so I felt bad for the day before our body cleared all that out)</p>

<p>and while being sick and liveblogging my poison adventure to my friends, as you do, i said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i dont think being a dragon would fix me but also it would be nice to have big wings to curl up in</p>
<p>im gonna fucking sicklink. coping with being poisoned v lightly id like to be a dragon for now bc i deserve it</p>
<p>"why are you draconic?" "the poisons got me"</p>
<p>all my friends are being dragons i should also be dragon</p>
<p>it will make me feel cool while curled up in bed w brain not working</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and thankfully I'm not sick anymore! but I think it would honestly be pretty neat to try out a copinglink! dragons can be anything, so I don't even need to figure out an exact shape, I can just kinda play around with it and see what's interesting</p>

<p>mostly what I've figured out is that I can conjure up vividly tactile phantom sensations, including limbs I don't have, and I really like having wings on my back! I like the imagined pressure and weight, feels like a combination of a backpack and a weighted blanket over my shoulders, except I can move them, which is really cool!</p>

<p>we've been playing around with some ideas in sketches - none of it is set in stone, but it's fun to brainstorm! I think a couple of my defining traits are being small (for whatever my species is) and fluffy (because I like being soft under the hands of my loved ones) lmao</p>
