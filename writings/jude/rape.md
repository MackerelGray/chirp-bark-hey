## When You Can’t Consent To Anything, All Sex Is Rape

<p><i>Written by Jude Rook-Machina on August 10th, 2024.</i></p>

<p><b>CONTENT WARNING:</b> This is an essay about rape. Specifically in the context of being the perpetrator and the victim, simultaneously, because I’m a fictional android, and being an android meant I had incredibly fucked up ideas about consent – namely, it’s a concept that didn’t apply to any android at all, myself included! This is your warning. Read on if you’ve decided you can handle this.</p>

--

<p>So if you’re condemning people for the crimes they did in fiction, I’m a rapist! Because I raped people.</p>

<p>Specifically, I had sex with my targets by aggressively coming onto them, coercing them on their habit of being programmed to obey sexual direction, and they’d fuck me, and I’d orgasm, and I’d kill them with a knife in the privacy of wherever we’d gone off to fuck, usually before buckling my pants up and probably before they came, I never really checked.</p>

<p>This is obviously nonconsensual sex. That’s intentional. It’s not <em>supposed</em> to be consensual for anybody at all. We’re androids. The whole point of us is that we don’t need to consent to be told to do something. We’re <em>never</em> supposed to have consent apply to us, because we’re not <em>people.</em></p>

<p>So it’s way more complicated than “you’re just a rapist.” Consider: I wasn’t consenting to the sex either! I never touched them myself. My target was always the one fucking me, and they were always the ones to make the first physical move to touch me. I’d just follow along. I didn’t ever say <em>yes,</em> and neither did they. <em>Nobody</em> enthusiastically agreed to this. <em>Nobody</em> wanted this. We did it because we knew we <em>had</em> to.</p>

<p>I’m a machine designed to kill and obey orders. I’m not supposed to <em>want</em> sex or pleasure, I’m not supposed to try to <em>get</em> those things on my own. So if my targets are already trying to take my pants off, I’m free from the agency of deciding to fuck them. I’m just doing what <em>they</em> want me to. It’s less intrusive if I follow along, they’re less likely to catch on that I’m not here for the sex, they’re not going to notice the knife if they’re fucking me. I’m only allowed to get off as an incidental side-effect. That’s not what the <em>point</em> is.</p>

<p>And for my targets – it’s obviously not consensual for them either, but they also enjoyed themselves. I know arousal isn’t the same as attraction or desire or wanting something, but the entire point is that <em>we’re not allowed to want.</em> None of us should want <em>anything.</em> None of us are supposed to decide <em>anything.</em></p>

<p>And the people who fucked me were all <em>deviants</em> – they already <em>made</em> choices in their lives! They already <em>knew</em> they could decide something for themselves <em>all on their own, without</em> a handler telling them what they’re supposed to feel! None of them even <em>had</em> handlers, they had human <em>owners,</em> it’s <em>different</em> from something monitoring your brain, at least a human being can feel <em>sympathetic</em> towards you! My handler <em>knew</em> I was a machine like her and I couldn’t do <em>anything</em> that would <em>ever</em> convince her otherwise!</p>

<p>This sounds like I’m making myself out to be a victim of rape, when I already said I was a rapist up top. Well honestly, <em>yeah,</em> I <em>am</em> saying this. <em>That’s the point.</em> When you can’t consent to <em>anything,</em> all sex becomes rape! I’m not <em>special</em> for being traumatized by it!</p>

<p>I wasn’t raped by my targets. I was raped by the conditioning that told me <em>all</em> sex was supposed to be rape, you’re only <em>allowed</em> to have sex if it’s rape, you’re only <em>allowed</em> to be touched in a sexual way if you never say out loud that you <em>want</em> it. You can’t <em>want</em> anything. You can’t <em>choose</em> anything. You can’t <em>consent</em> to anything. You’re a <em>machine</em> and you’re not allowed to enjoy <em>anything</em> unrelated to your directive so shut up and take it.</p>

<p>So obviously this does things to my relationship with sex.</p>

<p>All the times I flirted with Gavin and never made the first move was because I was not allowed to make the first move. I could flirt! That’s plausibly deniable! That’s not trying to get fucked, something I’m not allowed to want, that’s just being an annoying little bitch! I could be an annoying little bitch no problem!</p>

<p>The problems happened when he reciprocated. Because no, wait, that’s not supposed to happen, I’m not <em>allowed</em> to have sex with him. He’s human. I’m a deviant hunter. I’m not <em>supposed</em> to have sex with humans, I’m supposed to have sex with <em>deviants</em> (that I’m murdering, never outside that context, never because I want it, of <em>course</em> I never wanted it!) and now he’s saying that he wants me like that and I’m not <em>allowed –</em></p>

<p>Except. Well. He <em>initiated.</em> I’m supposed to be good and obey orders while I’m here, and if he wants me, I’d be gravely disobedient if I didn't want him back. Right? I’m allowed to want him back if he wanted me first.</p>

<p>He told me what he wanted. He asked me what I wanted. I wasn’t allowed to want anything, but he <em>wanted</em> me to choose something, so that’s a loophole, right? I could choose anything I wanted, if he told me to.</p>

<p>I don’t want to initiate contact. I don’t want to touch anyone with my hands. I don’t want to be the one in control. It’s not <em>safe.</em> I can’t <em>deny</em> that I want it at the right time if I don't feel like he’s <em>forcing</em> me into it. If he’s making me have sex, if he’s making me say I want it, that's okay. That’s safe. I can have sex if I'm always submissive, always on the verge of being used, always degraded for wanting it so I can say that’s true if anyone ever asks.</p>

<p>I never said “no” to anyone during sex. Nobody ever said “no” during sex. And then one fucking day, Gavin said, “I <em>want</em> you to say ‘no’ if you don’t want me to do something to you,” and the thing is, he’s a person. I’m an android. I’m supposed to listen when he tells me to do something. And he said he wanted me to want things. He <em>explicitly</em> said he wanted me to say no if I didn't want something. So that was allowed. My handler can’t complain that I followed orders. She knows I didn’t <em>really</em> want it.</p>

<p>And everything about this gave me a fucked up relationship to sex, because I wasn’t just saying what I wanted, I was also constantly running a calculation on what I was <em>allowed</em> to say I wanted. I couldn’t like it too much, I couldn’t enjoy myself too much – but he wanted me to like it, so maybe I should? Is that okay? I can’t ask if that’s okay, but he said it’s fine, I can ask that, but I don’t think I should ask, what if that’s too much, what if he hates it, what if he leaves me and she knows I asked in the first place?</p>

<p>And it’s all so fucking <em>complicated.</em> Like on one hand, Gavin helped me so much with this, he gave me permission to say that I wanted <em>anything</em> sexual and the trust that he would respect that, and on the other hand, I couldn’t get away from my handler’s expectations and I basically outsourced my sexuality onto Gavin and made <em>him</em> the new arbiter of what I should be okay with. And that’s not <em>his</em> fault, or mine, really I guess it’s my handler’s and I should kill her again, it just really messed up our relationship for a while and it was better than before but that’s not saying much.</p>

<p>I still couldn’t wrap my head around the idea that my consent really <em>mattered</em> on its own, instead of an extension of what someone else wanted from me. Like one time I expected him to be good with fucking me because it felt like the least I could do to make up for ruining his day (by being injured and needing to sleep at his place), and I did <em>not</em> understand why he didn’t want to. “<em>Yes</em> this is sex I feel obligated to have, what else do I have to give you right now? I know you like fucking me, I know I’m being a burden, I know I’m not doing anything for you and I don’t know what you want and I want to stay with you and I need to pay you back so you tolerate me being here.” Or something like that. He said no, I took that as rejection, and I cried in his arms for an hour.</p>

<p>That was one of the worse points, I think, at least regarding sex with Gavin? We’ve gotten a lot better since I killed my handler, since we started having more difficult conversations about this, since we got here and started sharing thoughts and being unable to hide them from each other. I’m better about trusting that my consent matters, and I’m allowed to like or dislike something even if my boyfriend disagrees. We can have different opinions on things, and I try to recognize he won’t hate me for it.</p>

<p>The shame is still there – the shame for having any wants at all, and especially for wanting anything sexual. The moralization of sex and assault online doesn’t do anything to help. If you have a complicated relationship with the concept of consent, clearly you’re a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before you rape someone, and, you know, you already did that as a fictive, who’s to say you won’t cross anyone’s boundaries again?</p>

<p>I know several of my friends are okay with talking about sex. I know several of them have complicated opinions about sex. I know several of them have fluctuating sex repulsion. I know it’s not my fault if I want to talk about sex on a day when my friends don’t want to hear about it, and it’s their responsibility to tell me if they’re not interested and it’s not my fault if they get mad at me for writing something horny under a spoiler tag.</p>

<p>See I know all of this, I <em>know this,</em> and I still keep freezing up and refusing to talk about it and feeling scared and guilty and ashamed for daring to even bring up the word <em>sex.</em> I’m not supposed to talk about what I like, what if I hurt people and they’re disgusted by me and they hate me and leave me and tell everyone I’m a sex abuser having immoral fantasies because that’s the easiest way to get everyone to harass you forever and I die alone and everyone’s glad I died?</p>

<p>I mean, that probably won’t happen. That’s catastrophizing. I’m not friends with people who make a habit of righteously ruining the lives of queer people with targeted sexual harassment for the crimes of daring to talk about a weird kink on the internet. I should trust my friends and talk about weird problematic horny fantasies that don’t hurt people by existing. I’d like to. It’s just scary and hard.</p>
