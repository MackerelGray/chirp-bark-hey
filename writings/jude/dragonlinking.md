## dragonlinking go brrrrr

<p><i>Written by Jude Rook-Machina on October 16th, 2025.</i></p>

<p>so the Linking is going great! I'm having FUN with this, hey fellow alterhumans we don't talk enough about how fun and enriching it can be to introspect and design forms for yourself that feel good and cool and right for you! copinglinks are cool and 'linking is cool and I'm having the time of my life</p>

<p>I have design notes after this, don't go anywhere :V</p>

<a href="https://ibb.co/7Nk2Xj8K"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/NnTZstQK/Screenshot-2025-10-15-112841.png" alt="Reference sheet of a Western dragon in profile, showing off their two knife-shaped horns, their fluffy furred mane and tail tip, and large pointed falcon-like webbed wings. The wing closer to the viewer is folded up, showing that their fingers curl up to reduce their visible wingspan (like a bat!) - the wing further away is stretched out, showing that it's as long as the dragon's torso and tail combined." border="0"></a>

The dragon has bright red scales, shading darker towards their feet and along the top side of their body. Their fluffy mane is bright purple, and that same purple colors their claws and the edges of their knife-shaped horns." border="0"></a>

<p><b>Design Notes!</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>small for a dragon, i Need to be a holdable size. bigger dragons can Pick Me Up</li>
  <li>fluffey because I like being v pettable and also with my history, I'm designed to look kinda cute and nonthreatening as a person!</li>
  <li>knife horns! because I thought oooooh my horns should look like my knives ðŸ‘€ yay my knives from my ex-job! \o/ tribute to them (emotional support knives for emotional support murder)</li>
  <li>big pointy ears for the dog energy! also the muzzle shape a bit</li>
  <li>falcon type wings because hunting by striking things very fast is very relatable and cool and fun, and i deserve Really Cool Acrobatics (dive bombing my enemies)</li>
  <li>(the "finger bending?" note on the art was me realizing "oh yeah fingers curl when relaxed, this also happens to bats. wing origami unlocked!" because earlier I was trying and failing to understand how I was supposed to walk around with wings that long)</li>
  <li>stripes because i like stripey patterns! they feel very me, i think we have a List of traits that max wrote for me in AUs and im sure "being stripey when animal" was on there</li>
</ul>

<p>and I chose this first option for color schemes because NEON SPARKLEDRAGON GO, I DESERVE THIS, and the colors have cool personal symbolism! but i also have other ideas! like</p>

<ul>
  <li>dark base with several bright colors</li>
  <li>bird of prey browns and barring</li>
  <li>brown but with huge neon eyespots or similar on the wings</li>
</ul>

<p>I have OPTIONS. I can do ANYTHING. this is actually too much power, I like making designs for myself and it's one of the most fun parts of making new AUs and this is a dragon AU but it's Also something I'm trying on here! for myself!! phantom scales and wings are really fun!</p>

<p>I'm thriving and in my lane and looking very cute about it :> I can be vain, dragons are vain! honestly a big reason I've chosen to be a dragon is because dragons are often really self-confident and I want to feel more of that! and it turns out that it's FUN and EASY to be confident when you're a BIG FLYING REPTILE with COOL HORNS and GEMSTONE COLORS! it's really hard to feel worthless when you're a fucking dragon! it rules! copinglinks rule! okay bye I'm gonna draw more art of myself</p>
