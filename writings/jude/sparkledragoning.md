## The Sparkledragoning Continues

<p><i>Written by Jude Rook-Machina on October 24th, 2025.</i></p>

<p>So since last time I've been drawing myself with different color schemes and trying them on, and honestly I do not have a favorite! These are all really fun! I said the first option was getting my sparkledragon energy out but honestly All Of These are sparkledragons in their own unique way. I deserve it! It's gender!</p>

<p>Gaze upon my beautiful form (that's gotten kind of a ridiculous amount of gift art from my friends, holy shit, how are you all drawing so fast?)</p>

The dragon has bright red scales, shading darker towards their feet and along the top side of their body. Their mane is bright purple, and that same purple colors their claws and the edges of their horns." border="0"></a>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I really like this one for being so proudly ridiculously neon, like so many birds and reptiles are! The colors aren't ones that I'd usually associate with myself, but I like them a lot because I associate them with a project some of my friends are working on, and they're meaningful within that system! Their kind of dragon shows their personalities on their scales, where a dragon's colors correspond to the personality or priorities they have - so in my case, being red means I'm freely emotional and value my feelings, and being purple means I'm persistent, I'm a survivor who struggled and kept living through it. Those are two traits I'm proud of myself for having and want people to see on me.</p>

They have a striking bright-on-dark color scheme, with most of their scales and fur mottled black while reflective cyan stretches in bands across their wings, also coloring in their horns and the edges of their mane." border="0"></a>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I <em>love</em> bright colors on dark backgrounds, that&#39;s my favorite thing to wear, I love strong color contrast! It just <em>looks</em> good! So you understand why I wanted to have a cyan on black design, it makes me happy to look at. The cyan&#39;s a fun little nod to being an android while not being mechanical in a way I find off-putting. A lot of this design was avian - I based the wing patterns off a Eurasian magpie, just switched around the black and white parts, and the bright highlights in the mane are inspired by the way pigeon and hummingbird throats gleam in the sun. I think they&#39;re neat!</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I thought it would be fun to have falcon-inspired wings in both shape <em>and</em> pattern, and then I thought about other patterns I like and tuxedo cats are definitely up there, so I combined the two! I like rich warm browns, they feel like a very Jude color, and cream fit in better than plain white for the lighter parts.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I wanted a design that looked plain and unassuming on the outside that could then flash some extremely bright colors when I opened my wings, both because I like the symbolism callback to my Act Really Normal (Then Surprise Them) hunting strategy and because it&#39;s pretty, and I deserve to be a dramatic bitch while fanning my wings for people. The eyespots are based off the ones found on butterflies and moths, though I can&#39;t deny the peacock influence because I also think I look fetching like this. Dragons want me, fish fear me.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> My friend Julian of the system of Wonderbeasts suggested adding some black to the brown design and I thought that was a great idea, because I had extra ideas I wanted to put somewhere! The black points are still cat-based, just a pointed coat instead of a tabby, and I was also inspired by house sparrows and cross foxes. It’s a fun pattern!</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> I like the way the black scales continue on from the throat patch, it adds a little design cohesion! Also reminds me of a Thomson&#39;s gazelle, and those are interesting little antelopes. I don’t have any special attachment to them, I just think it’s neat how many of my design choices were inspired by real animals we know about!</p>
