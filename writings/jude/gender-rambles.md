## Jude Rambles About Their Gender

<p><i>Written by Jude Rook-Machina on September 26, 2025.</i></p>

<p>This is a private essay – I’m going into the intricacies of my private gender presentation, which is different from the public one and not something I want to share with strangers. I might make a public version that doesn’t go into half of this, but that might just defeat the point of logging this as a journal entry for myself to catalogue and for my friends to look at. We’ll see!</p>

<p><b>Content Warning:</b> I talk a lot about genitals and sex, because my bottom dysphoria is a gleefully spinning roulette wheel that fucks me up and I deserve to talk about it.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>First off, what the fuck is my gender? What are my labels? Do I use specific words to talk about it?</p>

<p>Well, I’m nonbinary, and maverique specifically, which means I have a Distinct sense of gender that is <em>not</em> attached to manhood, womanhood, neutrality, genderlessness, nonhumanity, concepts, or metaphor. I’m genderful and that’s it. My gender is a constant presence that Exists Very Strongly, and beyond that I can’t tell you anything descriptive about it – hope this helps!</p>

<p>I’ve been struggling to talk about it for a while because, well, maverique is the best word I have, but that’s a ridiculously unhelpful description full of what my gender is Not instead of what it Is, and besides that, my gender presentation and dysphoria are both… complicated? Contradictory? In a very messy, disorganized sort of way from being nonbinary and plural. So I want to talk about it, for my own reference and to give to friends.</p>

<p>First off, I have a public and private gender. Public and private pronouns, at least, but I tend to explain my gender in different ways between public and private spaces.</p>

<p>In public, with acquaintances and strangers, I use they/them – I’ve tried out it/its, he/she, xey/xem, nothing else felt right. I don’t know why, but why does any set of pronouns feel right? I’m openly nonbinary and use my pronouns to signal that, and I don’t want any gendered terminology applied to me – <em>Except</em> if it’s in reference to my sexuality being Very Queer. I’m a person and a sibling and a partner, <em>and</em> I’m a boyfriend since I’m dating a man, and I’d be a girlfriend if I were dating a woman. Clearly my gender is bisexual. (I joke, but yeah, there’s something to that.)</p>

<p>In private, with friends, I’ll use she/they. I don’t trust strangers to call me <i>she</i> in a genderqueer way, instead of assuming that I’m woman-lite or woman-aligned or associating with womanhood. I’m not a woman, but I <em>am</em> transfeminine, and I use she/her among close friends, usually when it’s obviously nonbinary and gender nonconforming – e.g. that’s Jude, she’s Gavin’s boyfriend. Sometimes I only want to use <i>she,</i> sometimes I want to alternate between <i>she</i> and <i>they</i> every other paragraph, sometimes I only like <i>they.</i> It varies. <i>She</i> is a very contextual pronoun, it feels better or worse at different times, and I’m not comfortable using it around strangers, at least not at the time of writing this.</p>

<p>My gender also feels consistently tied to my body, and that carries over to our body when I’m fronting, because I associate myself with the physicality of it; it’s not generically <em>The Body</em> that we all live in, it’s <em>My Body</em> while I’m in the front seat. I’m pretty solidly embodied, with all the pros and cons you might expect from that.</p>

<p>I’m transfeminine in gender presentation, not gender identity – I don’t Feel feminine on the inside, but I’m happy and comfortable when I Look feminine. I don’t want to overtly masculinize, but I’m part of a system that’s doing that. My boyfriends are taking testosterone and I share a body with them, so I also end up affected by T. I feel fine with it sometimes – like, we share an endocrine system, and now we all feel bad when we miss a dose, and I don’t mind it as a hormone itself, hormones are neutral. I even like some of its effects!</p>

<p>But I don’t like being masculinized. I really don’t like being called a man, or <i>he,</i> or masculine, and that’s part of why I don’t front in public, because we outwardly present as a man. I want to be clean shaven, I don’t like having thick body hair, I can’t voice train or speak in my own voice while it’s dropping and cracking. (I mean, I can’t speak in my own voice <em>at all</em> around people offline. They only know Max exists. Still.)</p>

<p>Beyond gender dysphoria, I want to have gender <em>euphoria!</em> I want to have hair down to my shoulders, I want to wear bright colors and swishy fabric, I want to wear a sports bra, I want to be called <em>pretty.</em> And I can’t safely <em>do</em> things to feel happy and comfortable in my skin when we’ve worked so hard to be seen as a man, because any deviation from masculinity means we’re less respected as a person, and that hurts. I <em>wish</em> I could ignore what’s expected of us and just present however I want, but I can’t safely or practically do that. Sure, I can have all that back home, or in writing and art, but that’s hardly the same as having it <em>here.</em> It <em>sucks!</em></p>

<p>I’m allowed to pull the plug on our hormonal transition whenever I want. It’s my choice, since I’m the one who’s dysphoric about it. I don’t think I really want to stop right now – not menstruating anymore is really nice. My issues lie mostly with how I can’t change our gender expression without being called out as detransitioning us, how I can’t use my name or be seen as myself without calling our entire identity into question. It’s bigotry against genderfluidity <em>and</em> plurality. <em>Fun!</em></p>

<p>The rest of this is getting into more specific anatomy and sex characteristics, and how that affects me, because that’s a pretty big part of how I experience my gender. Woe, the horrors of having a physical form! (Some of it is nice! It’s just, ugh, the horrors.)</p>

<p>Like, I used to have dysphoria about our chest. I don’t have breasts as part of my body map, I never had them before getting here, it felt wrong to have them. Nowadays our chest is flat, which feels thoroughly right to me and everyone else in our system, but it makes me feel… really weird compared to other transfem people? Everywhere I look online, transfeminine transition is equated with growing breasts, and it seems like almost everyone is excited or happy about it. Most people who feel ambivalent about it seem to come around to it once they start feeling the effects.</p>

<p>I know that’s a normal part of going on estrogen, and obviously my situation is Different as part of a collectively transmasculine system on testosterone, but I still feel… inadequate, I guess? For not being able to relate to such an apparently common transfem experience? I think it’s the isolation, being nonbinary with a nonlinear transition, someone transfeminine who’s invisible in spaces for straightforward trajectories away from manhood towards womanhood.</p>

<p>I do like our chest now! I like the scars running across it, the way our silhouette looks in the mirror, the way we can do a push up and touch our sternum to the floor. It’s the kind of chest I like having, and I don’t want to <em>stop</em> feeling good about it because I keep thinking about how I don’t fit in with more binary-gendered singlet strangers.</p>

<p>Acknowledging that the stress exists is good for me, at least – that way I can figure out what it’s telling me. Usually it’s that I’m scared of rejection; I’m scared that being too different means I’m going to be alone. That’s normal to be scared of – with my history it’d be more surprising if I <em>wasn’t</em> scared of that. But it’s definitely better for me to stop judging myself against wider trends in identity-based communities. I know this already from being alterhuman and transspecies and aromantic, it’s about fucking time I apply that to gender.</p>

<p>And I have friends already! You’re probably reading this right now. You like reading about my experiences, that’s why you’re reading this! So wider community trends aren’t something I want to spend my time getting upset about. Fuck comparing myself to strangers, I’m doing my own thing and I’m the only Me around, I’d better be doing well at it.</p>

<p>So my top dysphoria is basically gone now, which is great! But the bottom dysphoria roulette wheel keeps trying to attack me with spears. It’s <em>really</em> unfair, come on.</p>

<p>I used to have very straightforward feelings about my genitals – I could not stand the idea of having a penis. Yes, this included bottom growth on testosterone. I could not call it a T-dick or feel comfortable around anyone calling it a T-dick. I did <em>not</em> want a dick attached to me, I didn’t want to look at it, the thought of touching it or using it to penetrate anything made me feel sick. It’s all very textbook transfem bottom dysphoria, what else is new.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I felt SO happy and euphoric about having a clit and a vagina, it’s kind of insane. I started having sex here and <em>immediately</em> took the genital real estate from Max and Gavin, because both of them are trans men who don’t even <em>want</em> to be sexually touched and I was the local transfem absolutely <em>thrilled</em> to have a cunt! It was great! Transgender sex exchange REAL for systems in YOUR area!</p>

<p>Unfortunately! This changed!</p>

<p>Okay, well it started out as a good change – I stopped having such horrible dysphoria about dick. For some time, I felt perfectly fine with the idea of having both or either! They both felt fine! I’m pretty sure it’s because I finally internalized that being nonbinary meant my dick was also nonbinary, so the dysphoria of having “a man’s genitals” just stopped bothering me so much. They’re <em>my</em> genitals, I get to say what gender they are, so obviously my dick is femme and nonbinary like the rest of me. Problem solved! You’d think that, right?</p>

<p>But <em>then,</em> like it was waiting to ambush me while my guard was down, my dysphoria started switching shit up on me. Like, one day I was good with anything, the next day I woke up and suddenly the word “clit” felt viscerally wrong and I felt right calling it a dick and I didn’t want to <em>think</em> about having a cunt.</p>

<p>And that kinda fucked me up, because up until that point I’d been tentatively gaining more confidence in calling myself transfeminine in-system rather than only saying that back home, and part of that was solidified by how <em>right</em> I felt having a cunt, and now I was just – not feeling good about it anymore? <em>What?</em> What were all the <em>months</em> of dysphoria about having dick for if I was going to feel <em>good</em> about it now? Was I backpedaling on my transition? Was I a freak for wanting to have sex like that? Was I fetishizing transfeminine bodies by liking my own dick? (No I wasn’t, I just have so much anxiety.)</p>

<p>So I had a couple breakdowns about no longer feeling neutral about dick and actually kinda liking it, and about no longer feeling good about cunt and feeling really dysphoric and weird about it. This lasted… maybe a couple days? I tried using one of our packers, and that helped! It felt comfortable.</p>

<p>And then it changed again, back to liking clit and cunt. Okay, cool, back to normal. Nope! Changed again. Dick. Again. Cunt. Over and over and over again, and it’s still happening, and I’m fully incapable of predicting when and how and why it’s going to switch up on me. (Though whatever dysphoria I’m feeling <em>does</em> feel worse when I’m anxious or stressed out, which makes sense – if I’m stressed about one thing, everything feels worse.)</p>

<p>You might think this sounds like genderfluidity – I also thought this! But it seems to be more confusing than that, because my gender refuses to be simple and easy to talk about, probably just to spite me.</p>

<p>I don’t experience genderfluidity – my <em>gender</em> is a static, constant thing, and it doesn’t change in any way when my dysphoria does. I don’t want to change anything about my presentation, my pronouns or the way I dress or how I want to be spoken to, and I don’t feel like what I want in my pants has any impact on my gender identity. I’m still a feminine nonbinary person, regardless of whether I want a dick or a clit or a jack. (We made up that last word, sexy term for any phalloclitoris, and I think I like it! Nice word for when the others feel wrong.)</p>

<p>So I’m not genderfluid. I’m… sexually fluid? No, that’s sexual orientation. Sexfluid? No, that’s cum. Genitalfluid? No, that’s still cum. Goddammit. Whatever, fuck labels, basically my sex feels separate from my gender, and my <em>sex</em> keeps changing on me while my gender stays the same.</p>

<p>(It’s honestly So frustrating that it keeps changing, I’d kill for some consistency. Sex change? I wish it would NOT, holy fuck.)</p>

<p>How my sex presents itself is actually kind of interesting to me? Whatever I settle on for the day, it’s almost always affected by being on cross-sex hormones. My default states are an androgenized clit or estrogenized dick – T-dick or girldick, either/or, larger than the average cis clitoris and smaller than the average cis penis. A lot of my dysphoria around having a dick is about using it like a cis man, and I think having a small dick helps with that? Can’t be expected to top with that, I’m supposed to bottom! It’s a little funny, and I’m not sure exactly how it works back home because androids don’t <em>have</em> hormones, but I guess customizing genitalia is a perk when they’re modular. (Jude can have little a penis. as a treat.)</p>

<p>Honestly, a lot of my gender feels related to sex – both the anatomy described above and what I do with that anatomy while <em>having</em> sex. I usually feel dysphoric about topping, unless it’s explicitly submissive and unmasculine, but I often get gender euphoria from <em>being</em> penetrated, or from grinding on something or using a vibrator. It feels gender affirming to get fucked like a woman, to be treated like I’m feminine in bed.</p>

<p>I said my gender was bisexual as a joke, but I think there might be <em>some</em> merit to it – my preferred terms change depending on the gender of my partner, but the kind of sex my gender feels affirmed in remains the same. It’s interesting! Differentiating between sexual orientation and gender identity is important, they’re not the same, but I think we’ve lost some space to talk about the overlap between them. I mostly see those conversations in gay and lesbian spaces, with twinks and bears and butches and femmes – they’re all gender presentations, yeah, but they’ve historically all been tied to queer sexuality. That really resonates with me, what with how much of my gender is connected to my body and what I want to do with it. And none of those terms are limited to monosexuality nowadays, so yeah, I’m femme – it’s a nice word, rolls off the tongue!</p>

<p>I don’t have a conclusion to this essay – it’s really just rambling for the sake of talking myself through how my gender feels right now. Nothing really new on the label end: I’m nonbinary, transfeminine, femme, maverique, and I guess some variety of sexqueer (queering sexual anatomy?) underlying all that. I somehow have 500% more gender dysphoria than Max and Gavin combined, which is understandable since we’re transitioning towards <em>their</em> gender presentations and away from mine, but it does kinda suck. I spent a <em>lot</em> of time talking about gender dysphoria. I guess it’s just something that messes with me a lot?</p>

<p>Actually, to end things on a high note, here’s a list of things that give me gender euphoria or help me cope with dysphoria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making or getting art of myself</li>
<li>Writing about myself with the right pronouns and referrals</li>
<li>Being called cute or hot or pretty, usually by my boyfriends</li>
<li>Wearing clothes that feel good (e.g. sports bra, comfy sweatpants, collared shirts)</li>
<li>Looking at clothes I’d like to wear (e.g. flower-patterned shirts, long coats, bright colors on black)</li>
<li>Packing with a cute packer (shout out to Bat Bites Art for the angel and werewolf dicks)</li>
<li>General self-care (eat regularly, drink water, take a shower, take medicine, talk to friends, sleep before midnight)</li>
<li>Dancing, going for a walk, having sex – using my body instead of thinking about it</li>
</ul>
