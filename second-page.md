# Chirp! Bark! Hey!

Funny plural system made of a murder chicken, a murder dog, and just some guy talk about their life.

## Welcome!

This is the personal website of Machina - a very human alterhuman plural system of three people, plus visitors - and it's a hub to keep and link to our personal identity essays and journaling.

We're all adults, so consider this a blanket warning that our writings will likely contain strong language, which we often use amongst ourselves. All sensitive content (e.g. violence, abuse, existential dread) that we're aware of is warned for in a <strong>Content Warning</strong> paragraph before the body of the post, but feel free to contact us if you noticed that we let something slip!

If you're not sure how to interact with us, we have an **[etiquette guide]()** which answers some frequently asked questions!

You can find most of our personal essays crossposted to our system's [Tumblr blog](https://knifedog-machina.tumblr.com), [Neocities site](https://chirp-bark-hey.neocities.org/), [Nekoweb mirror](https://chirp-bark-hey.nekoweb.org/index.html), or [Dreamwidth account](https://mackerelgray.dreamwidth.org), the last of which also posts more private writings (made available to view via requesting access, which we grant at our discretion).
