# Chirp! Bark! Hey!

Funny plural system made of a murder chicken, a murder dog, and just some guy talk about their life.

## Welcome!

This is the personal website of Machina - a very human alterhuman plural system of three people, plus visitors - and it's a hub to keep and link to our personal identity essays and journaling.

We're all adults, so consider this a blanket warning that our writings will likely contain strong language, which we often use amongst ourselves. All sensitive content (e.g. violence, abuse, existential dread) that we're aware of is warned for in a <b>Content Warning</b> paragraph before the body of the post, but feel free to contact us if you noticed that we let something slip!
